Hello, and welcome to my Introductory!
- My name is Marek Carlisle.
- I am interested in cats, space, computers, and games. 
- I study programming, computer science, cybersecurity, and a little of other sciences.

- I keep a small Discord server, join us for some fun: https://discord.gg/cwGXgxynQr

I love playing videogames, and doing things with computers and other technology. I study computer science topics for fun, and solving computer problems is a skill that I value within myself, as I love having technological freedom. I dream of one day putting these naturally developed tech skills to use in creating cash flow, and taking my craft around the globe. 
I want to become a freelancer, but I'm looking for professional work to help me get there.
