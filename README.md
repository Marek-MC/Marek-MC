- Hello, my name is Marek Carlisle.
- I am interested in cats, code, and games. 
- You can contact me via Email at MarekCarlisle@gmail.com.

I’m currently working on diversifying my skills, so that I can do more things with my time.
Right now I am most interested in learning how to be a programmer, so that I can begin my rise through the corperate world, and overtake my throne!
Eventually, I'd like to learn how to complete freelance projects, and work for a big company like Microsoft.
