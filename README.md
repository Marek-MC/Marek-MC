- Hello, my name is @Marek-MC!
- I am interested in cats, code, and games. 
- You can contact me via Email (MarekCarlisle@gmail.com)

I’m currently working on diversifying my skills, so that I can do more things with my time.
Right now I am most interested in learning web design code and art, so that I may explore the most creative parts of myself.
I would like to learn game design, and the arts behind it so that I could create the things that I love most.
