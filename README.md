I’m currently working on diversifying my skills, so that I can do more things with my time.
Right now I am most interested in learning web design so that I may enter the professional industry.
I would like to learn game design, and the arts behind it so that I could create the things that I love most.
However I have a lot to do, and much to learn. My custom ideal won't chase itself!
